This open-source **VC Claim Page** is a joint effort between the [Digital Credentials Consortium at MIT](https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/) and the [Learning Economy Foundation](https://www.learningeconomy.io). It works with the [Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/admin-dashboard) to provide enterprises, schools, and organizations with a straightforward way to issue Verifiable Credentials in bulk.

## Features of the admin-dashboard in general:

- **User Management**: Efficient user onboarding and management.
- **Credential Management**: Handle individual credentialsâ€”search, view, check status, and revoke.
- **Batch Management**: Manage groups of credentials, such as annual diploma issuances.
- **VC & Email Template Management**: Edit and store templates for credentials and emails.
- **White Label Ready**: Configurable branding options.
- **VC-API & CHAPI Integration**: Compatible with the Verifiable Credential API exchange endpoints and CHAPI.
- **Deployment**: Fully dockerized for ease of deployment.

## The claim page:

- **Claim Page**: Allows students to claim and download their credentials.

### Claim Page

This app serves the webpage that users see when claiming a credential.

It typically runs as a docker service in a docker compose network.

The app is configured by default to run at the path `/claim`. We've done this to more easily the allow the service to run within a docker compose network served on port 80 from a single domain. If you'd like to change the path take a look at [./src/pages/index.astro] and [./astro.config.mjs]

Similarly the app makes calls back to the [admin-dashboard](https://github/digitalcredentials/admin-dashboard) API assuming that the api is running on the same server, on port 80, at `/api`. Or, if the claim page is running on localhost, it will call the dashboard api at localhost:3000/api. If you'd like to change these, take a look at [./src/pages/index.astro].

- **Environment Setup**:
    - A sample environment file is provided as `.env.sample`.
    - Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and replace the dummy values with actual values for your setup.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The VC Claim page uses [Astro](https://astro.build). 

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
